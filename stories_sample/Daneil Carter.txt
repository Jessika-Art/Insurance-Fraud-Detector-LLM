Incident Description:  
On the morning of June 8th, I left for work at 7:00 AM. When I returned home at 5:30 PM, I found that my house had been burglarized. Several items were missing, including my 85-inch OLED TV, MacBook Pro, three Rolex watches, and a safe containing $15,000 in cash.

Interestingly, there were no signs of forced entry. The front door was locked and windows were intact. I believe the intruder may have used a spare key hidden under a garden rock, although I don’t remember placing it there.

I did not immediately report the incident because I was on a business trip from June 9–18 and didn't have time to file a report. Also, I had temporarily disconnected my home security system due to renovations in the hallway.

I don’t have any receipts or photos of the missing items, but I assure you they were present and valuable. I would appreciate swift reimbursement as I am under financial pressure due to unrelated medical expenses.
