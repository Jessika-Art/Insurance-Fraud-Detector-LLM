Incident Description:  
On the evening of August 14th, 2023, at approximately 8:45 PM, a severe thunderstorm caused significant damage to my home located at 2307 Pine Crest Lane, Madison, WI. High winds brought down a large oak tree, which fell directly onto the roof of my garage, collapsing the structure and damaging my parked car (2019 Toyota Camry).

I was at home at the time and immediately called 911. Emergency services arrived within 15 minutes. No one was injured, but the garage was completely compromised. I have included photos taken by the responding fire department, along with the report they filed.

I contacted a local contractor the next morning who assessed the structural damage and estimated a repair cost of $12,800. The car suffered roof and windshield damage, and I have attached an initial repair quote from Madison Auto Body.

I am requesting coverage for structural repairs, debris removal, and vehicle damage under my comprehensive homeownerâ€™s insurance policy.
